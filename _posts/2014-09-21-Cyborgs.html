An analysis of <a href="https://devart.withgoogle.com/#/project/18212081?q=twitter%20">noise and creative cognition.</a>

Framed by the following ideas from N. Katherine Hayles <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/poetics_today/v025/25.1hayles.html"> "Print is Flat, Code is Deep: The Importance of Media-Specific Analysis," Poetics Today 25.1 (2004), 67-90</a>

        <li>Digital art initiates and demands cyborg reading practices.</li>
        <li>It is generated through fragmentation and recombination.</li>
        <li>And, it is mutable and transformable.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    Noise and creative cognition is a digital art project by Sally Bell Thisissb and Sebastijan Placento that “takes tweets in a user’s geolocation, plots them on a google map so they can see the level of noise in different places, then transforms each message into an audio file that’s broadcast around the user to create a wall of sound to help their mind focus at an optimal 70db.” As such it converts a potential distraction into white noise creating a conducive environment for the user to focus on another task, eg. reading a text. This confluence of the project and the user creates a cyborg reader.

A cyborg is essentially part organism part machine. The proposed cyborg reader's organic part would pivot around his or her interaction with the project. This would involve turning on or activating the project, letting the twitter white noise block any other auditory distractions, and then selecting a text to read.

    <p>
The machine bit on the other hand involves scrubbing twitter for tweets in the user’s geolocation, and running these tweets through a digital signal modification module of sorts that’ll convert them to 70db sound. 
        </p>
    <p>This cyborg reader is already better adapted to reading on the web today, but, with an extension of his/her machine part, the reader could become even better suited to the task.
